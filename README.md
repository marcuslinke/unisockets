# unisockets

dressing up [unix domain sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) in a tcp [socket](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SocketChannel.html) shirt and tie.

## usage

_note_: This library requires at a minimum a java 7 jre. as the SocketChannel class changed to implement a new [NetworkChannel](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/NetworkChannel.html) interface in java 7.

A unix domain socket is typically a reference to a file descriptor. unisockets defines an implementation of a `SocketAddress` for
these file descriptors called `Addr`.

```scala
import java.io.File
val addr = Addr(new File("/var/run/unix.sock"))
```

You can create both instances of nio SocketChannels

```scala
val channel = unisockets.SocketChannel.open(addr)
```

and old io Sockets

```scala
val socket = unisockets.Socket.open(addr)
```

You can also create disconnected instances of each calling `open` without arguments and calling `connect(addr)` at a deferred time.

### netty

The `unisockets-netty` module provides a netty `NioSocketChannel` backed by a `unisockets.SocketChannel`, enabling you to
build netty clients for UNIX domain socket servers.

```scala 
import unisockets.ClientUdsSocketChannelFactory
val sockets = new ClientUdsSocketChannelFactory()
```

This nio socket channel factory share's many similarities with [NioClientSocketChannelFactories](http://netty.io/3.10/api/org/jboss/netty/channel/socket/nio/NioClientSocketChannelFactory.html)

Client's useing this interface should make sure they call `ClientUdsSocketChannelFactory#releaseExternalResources` to release any resources 
acquired during request processing.
